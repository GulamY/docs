## 1 Introduction

{{% alert type="info" %}}
App services are deprecated and from version 8.18, are no longer supported. They are replaced by [published web services](published-web-services) and [published REST services](published-rest-services).
{{% /alert %}}

An app service can be created via **File** > **New Document**.

Names of published app service documents must be unique (also with regard to published web service).
